**Lecturer:** Gergely Magyar, PhD (e-mail: gergely.magyar@tuke.sk)

**Teacher assistant:** Noebert Ferencik, MSc (e-mail: norbert.ferencik@tuke.sk)

**Lecture time:** TUE 10:50-12:20 (V4_102)

**Lab time:** WED 10:50-12:20 (BN3_23)

## Course objectives ##

The main goal of this course is to give an overview of social robotics and human-robot interaction focusing on humanoid-type robots. The class covers the design principles of robots, their hardware, what kind of sensors they are using and how they work, the use of artificial intelligence in HRI, affective computing in social robotics and concrete applications. For a more detailed list of topics please refer to the *Weekly schedule and assignments* section. The course covers the methodology of conducting human-robot interaction experiments which comes handy for students working on their semester projects. 

## Course assignments and grading ##

*Semester project:* Students conduct a project on a human-robot interaction topic in small groups (the list of this year's assignments can be found in the **assignments** folder). Their progress is reported every week during the lab. This assignment contributes 20% towards students' course grade.

*Reading assignments:* Reading assignments include peer-reviewed journal papers and or conference papers. The goal of these readings is to get additional information on the discussed topic and form the student's own opinion on the problem. The list of papers can be found in the *Weekly schedule and assignments* section. These assignments contribute 10% towards students' course grade.

*Mini quizzes:* Every lecture students get a question or two from the previous material to check whether they understood the presented concepts. These quizzes contribute 10% towards students' course grade.

*Exam:* Students are allowed to take the exam after successfully completing the course work described above. The exam is a written test including questions from the course material. The exam contribute 60% towards students' course grade.
